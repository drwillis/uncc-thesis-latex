% MARGINS
% All copies of a thesis/dissertation must have the following uniform margins:
% Left-hand margin: 1 ½ inches (to ensure sufficient room for binding)
% Right-hand margin: 1 inch
% Bottom margin: a minimum 1 inch
% Top Margin: 1 inch
% Exceptions: The copyright page must have a 2 inch Bottom margin, the first page
% of each chapter must have a Top margin that is 2 inches.
%%%%%%%%%%%%% UNC Charlotte Guidelines 2014 END (p4) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Make the top margin (from top edge of paper to top of header) be 3/4inch. This is
% needed to set the page number (which will be inside the header).
%\setlength{\topmargin}{-0.625in}

% Negative value because top margin = \topmargin + 1 inch (orig {-0.625in})
% (The amount .625 = .25 + .375 which accounts for the distance
% between the top of the pagenumber and the top of the header
% region.)
\setlength{\topmargin}{-0.425in}

% Make the left margin (from left edge of paper to left edge of body)be 1.5 inches.
\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{.5in} % Left margin = \oddsidemargin + 1 inch

% Make the top body margin (from top edge of paper to top of body) be 1 inch.
\setlength{\headheight}{0.25in} % Header height will 1/4 inch.
%\setlength{\headheight}{0in}

% This is not 0 to correct for the smaller \topmargin.
%\setlength{\headsep}{0.375in} % \headsep is the distance between topof body and bottom of header. (orig {0.375in})
\setlength{\headsep}{0.175in} % \headsep is the distance between topof body and bottom of header.

% Make the right body margin (from right edge of paper to right edge of body) be 1 inch.
% Total paper width = 8.5 inches so 6 in.+ 1.5 in. = 7.5 in
% which leaves 1 inch for the right margin.
\setlength{\textwidth}{6in}

% Make the bottom body margin (from bottom edge of paper to bottomedge of body) be 1 inch.
% Total paper height = 11 inches so 9 in.+ 1 in. = 10 in.
% which leaves 1 inch for the bottom body margin.

% LINE SPACING
%
%  a. All theses and dissertations are to be typed with double spacing between lines throughout.

% THESIS TEXT (required)
% Page Numbering (Arabic numerals (1,2,3,4,...) starting at 1)
%
% The organization and format of the text should be appropriate to the nature and scope of
% the research reported. The text must show logical organization; generally, the text
% includes an introduction or preface, a clear statement of the objectives, an appropriate
% review of previous research, a description of the materials and methods used in the research,
% a record of the results obtained, interpretive discussion of results in light of other
% research, and a summary of the significant findings of the study. Recommendations for future
% lines of study should also be included.
%
% For theses and dissertations of great complexity involving extensive cross-referencing and
% multiple subheadings, a decimal type of organization is suggested. If the decimal system is
% used for major and minor divisions of the thesis, it must be used throughout the entire 
% thesis or dissertation, including the appendices. It must also be used for numbering 
% equations, tables and figures. Once a suitable system of subdivision is selected, it should
% be followed consistently throughout the document; combinations of the decimal and the
% conventional or non-decimal systems are not acceptable. (See example in Table of Contents sample.)
%
% NOTE: Organizing the thesis or dissertation into chapters is not a Graduate School requirement;
% however, if you do separate the text into chapters, there is a specific format for the title
% (heading) of each chapter. See sample pages for examples. Either format is acceptable but be
% certain to apply one or the other consistently throughout your document.
%
% Format for chapter headings:
%  a. The first page of each chapter must have a heading that is capitalized and centered 
%     with a 2" top margin. The first page of each chapter is counted but the page number is omitted.
%  b. Skip two single spaced lines.
%  c. On the third single spaced line below the chapter heading, begin the text. The text is 
%     double spaced throughout. The only exceptions are noted within this manual.
%  d. Subsequent pages of the chapter have 1” top margins; page numbers in the text should 
%     be placed 0.75” from the top of the paper and 1" from the right edge of the paper.
% If chapters are not used but the text is still separated into sections (e.g., Introduction,
% Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion), each new section must have a heading using 
% the format below:
%
% Format for non-chapter headings:
%  a. Non-chapter headings should be capitalized and centered with a 1" top margin. The page is counted AND numbered.
%  b. Page numbers should be placed ¾" from the top of the paper and 1" from the right edge of the paper.
%  c. Skip 2 single spaced lines.
%  d. On the 3rd single spaced line below the heading, begin the text. The text is double spaced.
